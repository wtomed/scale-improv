#+TITLE: Classical Scale Work and Improvisation
#+AUTHOR: Tom Ed White
#+EMAIL: wtomed@gmail.com

* Introduction

  There are similarities between scale methodologies used in classical string training, and methodologies used for training in improvisation. This workshop will give participants a taste of what is involved in learning improvisation, through adapting traditional scale and arpeggio exercises to standard improvisational techniques.

  For those of you who have never been exposed to training in improvisation, the workshop will provide a gentle introduction. By relating the two techniques, the basics of improvisation will be de-mystified. This will help give you a way to decide if development of this skill set is something you might be interested in. In addition, I want to promote the theory that you can live in both worlds, without having to make a false choice between the two.
