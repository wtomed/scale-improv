* A workshop that ties classical scale work with training in improvisation

    There are similarities between scale methodologies used in classical string training, and methodologies used for training in improvisation. This workshop will give participants a taste of what is involved in learning improvisation, through adapting traditional scale and arpeggio exercises to standard improvisational techniques.

    For participants who have never been exposed to training in improvisation, the workshop will provide a gentle introduction. By relating the two techniques, the basics of improvisation will be de-mystified. This will help give them a way to decide if development of this skill set is something they might be interested in. In addition, I want to promote the theory that they can live in both worlds, without having to make a false choice between the two.
